# Palette Animation Database

Some maps utilize palette-based animation effects. These animations work by replacing color number 5 in the EGA palette (usually a dark magenta by default) with a different color. Anything drawn in color 5 anywhere on the screen -- regardless of what it is -- has its display color replaced by these animations.
