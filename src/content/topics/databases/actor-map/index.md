# Actor/Map Database

This page contains a pair of tables that cross-reference actor types with the list of maps that each one appears on.

{{< table-of-contents >}}

## Special Actors

{{< data-table/actor-map special_actor >}}

{{< note >}}
Special actor type 22 does not exist; it is a bug in the map. The game silently ignores it.
{{< /note >}}

## Normal Actors

{{< data-table/actor-map actor >}}
