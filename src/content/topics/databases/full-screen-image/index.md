# Full-Screen Image Database

This page contains a list of all full-screen images.

TITLEx and ENDx are somewhat special. The IDs are the same in all three episodes of the game, but the names vary ("x" is replaced with the episode's number). This is represented in the table as a single row, with all three variants in the "Description" column.
