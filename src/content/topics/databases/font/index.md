# Font Database

The game font consists of 100 characters. For the most part it correlates with the standard ASCII table, with a few sections removed. The `/` character was replaced with the symbol for the pound sterling, to facilitate displaying the game's price in the "Foreign Orders" screens.

The status health bars are also stored here, with each bar comprised of two characters (one for the upper half, and one for the lower).
