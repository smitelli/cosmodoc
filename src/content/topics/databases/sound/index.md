# Sound Database

The game's sound effects are split across three group entries, each containing 24 sounds. Only the first 23 sounds in each file are used by the game, and the third file is not filled.

The "ID" column corresponds to the number in the game's "Test Sound" menu. The "Group Entry"/"Index" columns refer to the content in the sound data files. The "Sound Name" values were found in the file headers. Not all sounds were given meaningful names.

"Length" is an estimate, based on a 140 Hz sampling rate with two bytes per sound sample.
