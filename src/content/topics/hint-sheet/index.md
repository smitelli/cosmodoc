### The Story of _Cosmo_

Cosmo is a young alien on his way to visit Disney World with his parents. That is, until their ship is struck by a blazing comet, forcing them to land on an uncharted planet.

While his Dad repairs the ship, Cosmo heads off to explore the strange planet. Upon returning, both his Mom and Dad are gone--and big, scary alien footprints are all around his ship! Oh no...has Cosmo's parents been captured? Possibly to be eaten? Well, Cosmo is off to the rescue.

Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure is an exciting journey across a forbidden planet full of dangers and surprises. Can he save his parents before they're lightly seasoned and devoured?

Cosmo is a lovable extra-terrestrial with a special ability: He has hands that work like suction cups! He can cling to walls, ledges, and all sorts of things. Using his suction hands, Cosmo is able to avoid dangers, scale cliffs and get to places other aliens can't reach. (This ability has never been seen in a game before--it's really fun!)

### Starting the Games

You must first install each of the three volumes before playing. Type INSTALL to get further instructions. After installation is complete, the three volumes may be played by typing either "COSMO1", "COSMO2" or "COSMO3".

### General Hints

* Use the up and down arrow keys (or push up and down on your joystick) to view areas above and below Cosmo. The playfield will scroll up and down allowing you to see new areas. Many times, prizes such as stars are hidden in high places, and will fall down to you if you look upward and spot them.
* Use three bombs to destroy Monuments (black walls that throw you backward when touched).
* In Adventure One, at the end of level three, there is a scooter hidden at the top of a tree that can be used to grab all the prizes hidden in the trees.
* In Adventure Two, in level seven, you can rescue Duke Nukum [sic; this was the official spelling for a brief time], who will reward you with a hamburger.
* In Adventures Two & Three, jump on the large red legged creatures to earn extra stars.
* In Adventures Two & Three you can jump on big yellow flying bugs to get to secret areas.

### How to Earn Extra Points

* There are three secret 50,000 point bonuses you can earn in _Cosmo_: 1) Jump on ten creatures and/or barrels/baskets without touching the ground. 2) Blow up 15 Eye Plants on a level. 3) Jump on all the barrels and baskets on a level.
* Blow up the hint globes to get 12800 points.
* Grabbing a power up module (which adds to your health) while you are already at full health will earn you 12800 pts.
* Jumping on a falling parachute creature is 12800 pts.
* You can blow up just about _any_ moving object for points, including spikes and most plants that move.

### Secret Tricks

* In Adventure One, on level seven, you'll see three robots that shoot an electric beam upward. If you blow up this robot the beam will turn into stars.
* Blowing up an Eye Plants [sic] will give you an extra bomb. Therefore, blow up an enemy on top of an Eye Plant, and you have not lost a bomb.
* In Adventure One, on level six [sic; should be five], there is a hidden satellite. Use two bombs on this satellite to earn a hamburger, which gives you greater health capacity.
* After every two levels there's a "Bonus Stage" that you can go to if you collect enough stars. Grab 25 stars to go to the first bonus level, and collect at least 50 stars to go to the better bonus level.
* A line of bombs on the ground will act like a fuse if you blow up the first bomb from either side.

### Secret Cheat Keys

We don't recommend anyone cheating when playing _Cosmo_, but sometimes we all get so stuck that we need a bit of help. If you press these three keys \[C] \[0] \[F10] (the middle key is zero) simultaneously, you will receive full health and a complete supply of nine bombs (the most Cosmo can carry at a time).

* Programming note: _Cosmo_ has 24500 lines of code!
