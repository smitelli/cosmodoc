# Function Index

Between the game code and the C library routines used by the game code, there are {{< index/num-functions >}} functions defined and documented in this project. This is a centralized, alphabetical (A&ndash;Z, a&ndash;z) index of all of these functions, their definitions, a brief description of their purpose, and a link to the page section that describes each in greater detail.
