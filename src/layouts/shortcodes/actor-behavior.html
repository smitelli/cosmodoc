{{/*
    Builds a <table> containing some actor/player interaction behavior data.

    Named parameters (all are optional and have some reasonable default):
        harmful: "true" if the player can be hurt by this actor type.
        pounces: Number >0 indicates actor can be destroyed by that many
            pounces.
        pounce-points: Number of points earned for pouncing. Only displayed when
            pounces > 0.
        explosions: Number >0 indicates actor can be destroyed by that many
            explosions and/or bombs.
        explosion-points Number of points earned for exploding. Only displayed
            when explosions > 0.
        name-origin: Brief explanation of the origin of the name, passed
            unmodified. There are a few special strings for boilerplate:
            * hint-sheet: Name came from the hint sheet text.
