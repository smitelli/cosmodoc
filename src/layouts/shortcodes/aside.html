{{/*
    Wraps the inner markdown content in a <blockquote> tag with an optional class
    name. Returns HTML containing this wrapped content.

    This should really be <aside>, but that causes the Firefox reader mode (at
    least) to hide the element which skips valuable content. <blockquote> is the
    next-best thing that visually sets the content off in this view.

    Named parameters:
        class (optional): Class value to add to the <blockquote> tag.
