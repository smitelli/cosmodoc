    Provide as much data as possible for the "Global Variables" and "Borland
    Library" pages from the cref data file. The result is a consistent H2
    element, syntax-highlighted C declaration, and description paragraph. Each
    entry is preceded by a horizontal rule to keep things from getting unruly.

    This is important to make sure that the heading ID (and anchor/fragment) get
    _exactly_ the name that the rest of the pages use to look up the symbol.

    Positional parameters:
        0 (required): C symbol name to look up for this invocation.
